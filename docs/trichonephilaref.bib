abstract = {[Anelosimus studiosus (Theridiidae) displays a more primitive form of social organization than its neotropical quasisocial relative A. eximius. A. studiosus social behavior consists almost entirely of subsocial elements. Colonies are founded by single females which have been driven from the parent colony by their mothers or by other females. Although females are mutually intolerant, juveniles and males are freely tolerated in colonies and participate with the mother in cooperative predation and feeding, and to a lesser extent in the construction and maintenance of the web. The most important evolutionary advance of A. eximius over A. studiosus appears to be the persistence of the brood in the common web after maturity, which greatly increases the effectiveness of cooperative activities. The evolution of tolerance between the females of A. eximius may be related to the differences in the apparent species recognition mechanisms of the two species. The most important selective factor leading to the evolution of large, perennial colonies, such as occur in A. eximius and other social spiders, may be the utilization of marginal habitats and portions of the prey spectrum which are relatively unavailable to solitary spiders of similar size.]},

abstract = {Orb-weaving spiders Metabus gravidus (Cambridge) (Araneae: Araneidae) spin, maintain, and defend individual webs. Colonies of 5-70 spiders form multilayered meshes of orbs connected by common support lines over mountain streams at the study site, Monteverde, Costa Rica. Habitat selection, preference for spinning within a group, and main- tenance of year-round population levels result in relatively permanent aggregations. Grouped spiders can build orbs in areas of high prey density more efficiently than single spiders, but they do not cooperate in web construction or food capture. Activity patterns relate closely to prey abundance and also depend upon individual energy demands. Cost-benefit analysis for different positions within the colony suggests no single optimal position on the basis of prey capture and the construction, maintenance, and defense of orbs. Colonies are maintained by the composite movements of unspecialized individuals, which benefit in the exploitation of resources not available to solitary spider.},

abstract = {Male choice is receiving greater attention from biologists, but remains understudied compared to investigations of female choice. I studied male choice and its potential role in size-assortative pairing in the jumping spider Phidippus clarus. Adult males cohabit with and guard immature females shortly before they mature. During this period, I monitored the sex ratio and maturation rate of females in the field, because these parameters can influence conditions favouring male choice. The adult sex ratio was initially male biased and became female biased following a relatively synchronous female maturation period. I collected male-female pairs from the field and found that they were size-assortatively paired for tibia length. I then tested whether males could discriminate between females by size, using tibia length as a measure of size. Both small and large males preferred to pair with large females that matured sooner compared with small females that matured later. Males also discriminated between females when exposed only to female silken nests, suggesting that cues associated with silk convey information about maturation and tibia length, two characters that were highly inversely correlated. Finally, large males were more likely to defeat small males in male-male contests, and as the size disparity between contestants increased, the likelihood that the larger individual would win also increased. A male preference for larger females combined with a large male advantage in male-male contests is likely to strongly influence size-assortative pairing. Species that are known to mate or pair assortatively may be valuable for studies of male choice. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract = {The evolution of polyandry remains controversial. This is because, unlike males, in many cases multiple mating by females does not increase fecundity and inevitably involves some costs. As a result, a large number of indirect benefit models have been proposed to explain polyandry. One of these, the good sperm hypothesis, posits that high-quality males are better sperm competitors and sire higher-quality offspring. Hence, by mating multiply, females produce offspring of superior quality. Despite being potentially widely applicable across species, this idea has received little attention. In a laboratory experiment with yellow dung flies (Scathophaga stercoraria) we found that males that were more successful in sperm competition also had offspring that developed faster. There was no relationship between paternal success in sperm competition and the ability of offspring to survive post-emergence starvation. Since faster development times are likely to be advantageous in this species, our data provide some support for polyandry evolving as a means of producing higher-quality offspring via sperm competition.},

abstract = {Cyrtophora moluccensis (Doleschall) in New Guinea and C. citricola Forskal in the Mediterranean and Africa form persistent aggregations of individuals of all ages. Characteristic of this “communal” organization (as defined by Wilson, 1971) in C. moluccensis are low level aggressive interactions during prey capture and during web repair and renewal. Such interactions may serve as a spacing mechanism, ensuring an adequate fool supply for each individualDisadvantages resulting from conspicuousness and persistence of C. moluccensis colonies are a high incidence of parasitism and a large degree of colony avoidance by flying insects (potential prey). Advantages of communal organization postulated for C. moluccensis includes increased protection of egg-cases and young, greater web building efficiency, greater prey capture efficiency, and the ability to exploit habitats that are unavailable to solitary species. Evidence is presented for the first and last of these hypotheses.It is suggested that due to its durable, 3-dimensional web Cyrtophora species could invade grassland habitats exposed to frequent and heavy wind and rain (Lubin, 1973). Colony formation then evolved in the larger species, C. moluccensis and C. citricola, as a means for exploiting large, open spaces that are rich in flying insects and poor in competing araneids. Under such optimal conditions, low level aggression occurring during prey capture and web construction may be interpreted as instances of reciprocal altruism among related colony members.},

abstract = {Reproduction has classically been viewed as a predominantly cooperative process. However, over the last 20 years this concept has steadily yielded ground to one of continual conflict in which the interests of the sexes are typically discordant. Within this framework, males and females are seen to be locked into a perpetual arms race, each adaptation by one sex promoting the evolution of countermeasures in the other sex. However, under strict genetic monogamy, the interests of the sexes become congruent, and hence antagonistic coevolution does not occur. We subjected the fly Sepsis cynipsea, a species with conspicuous sexual conflict, to experimentally enforced monogamy or polyandry for 29 generations and evaluated the microevolutionary consequences. We found that there were longevity costs to females consistent with sexually antagonistic coevolution. However, our measure of female fitness, offspring emergence, did not differ between treatments, even though life-history characters such as fertility and fecundity did. Results are discussed in terms of costs and benefits of sexual selection and sexual conflict.},

abstract = {[A high degree of mobility was observed in a population of Nephila clavipes (L.) (Araneae; Araneidae) in southeastern Peru, September-December, 1979. Prey capture and consumption were measured relative to the number of kleptoparasitic spiders (Araneae; Theridiidae; Argyrodes sp.) in the webbing. Those N. clavipes that moved their webs shortly after observation had consumed significantly fewer prey items than those that maintained their web site. However, total prey capture was not different between the two groups. Prey consumption was significantly reduced by each additional kleptoparasite in the web. Consequently, there was a complete correlation between the number of Argyrodes individuals in a spider's web and the percentage of those spiders that relocated their web. /// Высокая степень подвижности наблюдалась в популяции Nephila clavipes (L.)

Aiming to increase the knowledge about this unique strategy, we describe activities accomplished by the kleptoparasitic spider Argyrodes elevatus (Theridiidae) in webs of captive host spiders. After a prey was captured by the host spider, a second prey was offered, so that the kleptoparasite could steal the first prey while the host spider was immobilizing the second one. Using this method, we were able to see a wide range of events, such as the theft of stored preys, the sharing of a prey with the host, the theft of the egg sacs, the predation of host spiders, and others. Finally, we discuss how kleptoparasitism could vary in function of host behavior and how the high behavioral variability of Argyrodes elevatus could be explained.},

abstract = {In animal species where females mate with multiple males, female mating success might be expected to covary with aspects of female morphology, such as size or shape. Spiders are especially interesting in this regard, as the females of several spider groups weave intricate webs that often accommodate multiple male spiders, all of whom are potential mates. Because web design is likely to be dependent on female size/shape, we use multivariate methods to assess the relationships among female morphology, web design, and reproductive ecology over a range of body sizes in the orb-weaving spider Nephila clavipes. Of the measured variables, only abdomen size explained a significant amount of the variation in number of males on a web, and this relationship holds even after statistically accounting for body size. Because abdomen size is an indicator of body condition in spiders, we suggest that condition is likely to be an important factor relating to potential mating success in female spiders. We found no evidence for an association between web design and number of males on a web, although our data indicate that larger females build webs that are both larger and further from the ground than those of smaller females. {\textcopyright} 2006 The Linnean Society of London.},
